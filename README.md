#AMControl

##Description

With this small Mac OS X (10.9, 10.10) App you can start and stopp the Mac OSX-builtin Apache and MySql Servers.
It is like a tiny version of the XAMPP Control without additional software and overloaded stuff.

This is how the App looks in Mavericks.

If you want to use the app you have to compile it with xcode or you can download this repo as zip file, extract it and put the AMP Control.app to your Applications folder.
